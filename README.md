# SHAP-Analysis-of-Loan-Default-Prediction
This project focuses on building a highly interpretable machine learning model to predict loan default risk and explaining its decisions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Instead of relying only on accuracy metrics, the project emphasizes model transparency, enabling financial institutions to understand why a prediction was made.
